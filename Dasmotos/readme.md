# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts
***Codecademy FullStack Development**
  *Developing with CSS*
* Utilitize CSS and HTML with minimal guidance  
* Practice creating a site from mockup jpg
* Use dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg

This is the first time Codecademy wants a student to create a site utilizing HTML and CSS on their own.  Expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and any other resource necessary.

## Modifications
* Redline noted header using 100px text size, but visual showed 50px.  Chose to use 50px
